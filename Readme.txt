About SLaB

SLaB is a collection of useful and reusable classes, controls, tools, and framework code built for Silverlight 4 and beyond.  It provides reference and generalized implementations that take advantage of Silverlight features to enable rapid development for common scenarios.  In particular it focuses on improving the declarative experience with Silverlight in order to allow developers to focus on application concerns rather than re-implementing common patterns and scenarios.

The libraries are divided into independently useful assemblies so that you can opt into small, useful packages rather than be forced to take large dependencies.

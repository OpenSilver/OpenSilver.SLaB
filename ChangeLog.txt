---------------------------------------

v0.9, 9:38 PM 7/23/2010
---------------------------------------
-Added XamlSerializer and UiXamlSerializer for producing Xaml from POCOs or UI/DependencyObjects
-Updated MEFContentLoader to include Glenn Block's changes from his talk, supporting MEF's Xap loading (sorry for the long delay on this -- didn't realize those changes had been made until someone brought it up to me!)
-Fixed a bug with PackUriParser that caused navigations between pages within the same assembly (using full pack Uris) not to update the browser's address bar as users moved from page to page
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.85, 1:55 AM 5/29/2010
---------------------------------------
-Fixed a bug with ZipUtilities that caused files in folders within zips not to have the correct path
-Updated the CreateExtmap build task, which should hopefully resolve issues people were having using it

v0.8, 9:54 AM 5/24/2010
---------------------------------------
-Added RemoteControl, which downloads and instantiates a control from a remote XAP, which is useful for making installable apps that use assembly caching.
-Added SLaB:PageResourceContentLoader, a replacement for the built-in PageResourceContentLoader, which supports loading pages in dynamically-loaded XAPs.
-Fixed bugs with the XapLoader that prevented it from working with certain app manifests (in particular, those that have out of browser settings)
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.7, 12:39 PM 5/7/2010
---------------------------------------
-Added TryImportResourceDictionary that allows XAML resource dictionaries to be imported but fail quietly (so that if not all dependencies for a control are met, other controls in the library (that share the same generic.xaml) can still be used.
-Added XamlDependencyAttribute, which ensures that Xaml-only assembly dependencies can be declared and appear as dependencies in the assembly metadata.
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.6, 5:45 PM 4/25/2010
---------------------------------------
-Made CollectionPrinter work for controls like DataGrid when they auto-generate columns for generic collections (based on the type in IEnumerable<T>)
-Added a utility method that allows you to get the MethodInfo for an arbitrary method, including private ones (from anywhere that the method is accessible)
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.5, 5:21 PM 4/15/2010
---------------------------------------
-Updated for SL4 RTW
-Added CollectionPrinter for printing collections of items
-Fixed a bug with Sitemap-based controls that caused some pack Uris to be evaluated as "equivalent" (and thus highlighted) even when they were not
-Added EvenOddConverter that allows you to select an arbitrary value based on whether the input value was even or odd
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.4, 5:34 PM 3/15/2010
---------------------------------------
-Added ZipUtilities so that the contents of a zip file can be discovered
-Updated XapLoader to use ZipUtilities, allowing all TPEs to work rather than being limited to single-file TPEs where the file is named the same as the zip
-Added Sitemap-based controls: BreadCrumbNavigator and TreeViewNavigator
-Added ChangeLinq libraries for working with INotifyCollectionChanged collections and LINQ
-Added ObservableDictionary and BindableDictionary, which raise INotifyCollectionChanged and INotifyPropertyChanged events as the dictionary changes, making it more usable with Binding
-Added a basic MEFContentLoader
-Updated to use XmlnsDefinitionAttribute wherever possible
-Added XmlnsDefinition attributes to all libraries and updated ScratchApplication to use them
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.3, 7:25 PM 1/31/2010
---------------------------------------
-Added more extensible UriMapper that replicates the built-in UriMapper's behavior but allows UriMappings to be more extensible.
-Added UiUtilities, the first of which allows you to execute a function on the UI thread and block the calling thread until it has completed (safe to call even from the UI thread)
-Added XapLoader, which downloads a Xap and any "cached assemblies"
-Added XapContentLoader, which uses the XapLoader to navigate to pages in downloaded assemblies
-Added PackUri utilities so that pack Uris can be used to download and navigate to pages in Xaps
-Signed all assemblies (public binaries use a private key, another key is distributed with source)
-Added a build task that will generate extmap files for all libraries -- now assembly caching works with SLaB assemblies
-Fixed a bug with the AuthLoader where all rules would be run, even if one rule already allowed access
-Other minor bugfixes

v0.0.2, 11:24 AM 12/31/2009
---------------------------------------
-Moved ErrorPageLoader into its own project
